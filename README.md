# Spree One-Page Checkout

This Spree extension replaces the default Spree checkout workflow with a
streamlined one-page checkout, with reusable address and credit-card
features.

## Example

To be added.

## Testing

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle exec rake test_app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
